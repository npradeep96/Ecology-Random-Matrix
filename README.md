# Ecology-Random-Matrix
Code to investigate stability and dynamics of large ecosystems using random matrix theory. Done for 8.592 course project where I studied the ecology of systems containing a large number of interacting species using random matrix theory. The associated write up containing main findings of the project can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o02ml8ct3ijoio8qg7av5/Pradeep_Natarajan_8592_report.pdf?rlkey=pjodn1036drpzvnwbu0t1uptg&dl=0
